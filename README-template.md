## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt a lot of things that I didnt't know working on this project.
I didn't know almost nothing about JavaScript, so this was my first project built using it. 
I also learnt I lot of unkown CSS properties and how to work with animations. And now I can work with media queries.


### Continued development

In general I want to continue to study JavaScript, theres's a lot of things I don't know.
